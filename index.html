          Let's Help Those Who Are <br />
          More In Need
        </h1>
        <p>
          We should always help people who are in need. In almost any place in
          the world today. Offering help or aiding another person even in the
          simplest ways, can go a long way. However, help should be extended to
          those who are victims of calamities such as flood, earthquakes and
          poor people whom we encounter everyday.

            Provide nutritious meals to the poor and needy people. Donating
            groceries can help end the hunger of poor and needy people. They
            cannot even afford a single time meal for themselves and their
            family, so donating food will make their stomach fill and stay
            healthy. Rather than wasting food or throwing it, it is better to
            give it to a needy person.

            Anyone can be homeless at any time. While most people can't fathom
            the idea of not having a roof over their head or a daily shower,
            millions of people suffer everyday with homelessness. Unfortunately,
            the number of homeless people far outweighs the number of shelters.
            You can help people by starting your own nonprofit homeless shelter,
            but be prepared for a lot of hard work.

            Imparting knowledge can help the poor and needy to stand on their
            feet. Education is the beginning of getting out from hardships of
            life. Giving free education to the poor and needy people help them
            to grow as individuals and help them lead a better life. Education
            can help them to get a job, be employed build career and achieve
            success, capability of handling problems and lead a successful life.
            The poor and needy people can become independent, self-sufficient
            and better human being through the power of education. Through
            education, we can help the poor and needy people to develop their
            skills so that they can take over efforts to revitalize their life
            rather than always depending on the outsiders to do so for them.
